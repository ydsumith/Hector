Password generation-encryption-decryption tool

**Description**
This software can be used to generate complex password by memorizing hotel name, floor, room number etc.
You can also generate a super-strong random passord for your personal use.
Additionally, you can hash-enrypt any strong password and store it anywhere and later retrieve using decryptor.

See documentation on how to use it.
